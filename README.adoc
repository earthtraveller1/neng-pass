Therefore, I have been kind enough to provide you, the non-programmers who happens to on GitHub for some reasons, the EXE file.

https://github.com/earthtraveller1/neng-pass/releases/download/1.0/neng-pass-gui.exe[neng-pass-gui.exe]

Please appreciate this grand act of kindness, as you will likely not see it from other developers on this wicked site.
